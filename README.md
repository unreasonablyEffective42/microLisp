MicroLisp is a lightweight lisp interpreter loosely based on the syntax and semantics
of the Scheme programming language.

This is an honors project for my Java programming class at CCD.

To build, clone the repository and from MicroLisp, javac -d ./out ./src/*.java 
Then to run just java -cp ./out/ MicroLisp (optional files to be loaded)

This interpreter currently supports int32, and their arithmetic operations,
string literals, lists, functions and recursion.
